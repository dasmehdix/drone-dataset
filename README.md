This dataset prepared for academical and competition purpose.The main idea of this dataset is to guide our drone to other drones.The dataset includes ~1400 drone images and label files.The labes files are in format of both .txt and .xml.So, You can use it with Tensorflow, Darknet and PyTorch too.Most of images taken from Google and Yandex's image search toolbox.The other images are croped from drone videos that I downloaded Youtube.The results are very good.
